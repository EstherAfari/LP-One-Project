# LP-One-Project
A Data Analytic Project On the Indian Startup Ecosystem
# Introduction
An extensive summary of the Indian startup ecosystem covering the years 2018 through 2021 is given in this README. 
The project's goal is to provide decision-makers who are thinking about entering the Indian startup scene with data-driven insights.

# Objectives
Gaining traction in the Indian startup scene is the main goal. To ensure the success of the business, it is necessary to examine the current systems using the data that is currently available in order to determine their viability and suitability.

# Hypothesis 
In order to investigate whether financing is independent of or dependent on industries, two hypotheses are developed to examine the relationship between the industries and funding.

# Questions for Business:
In addition to addressing funding trends over time, top industries, location's impact on financing, regional funding distribution, top firms, stage analysis, annual funding leaders, and patterns in headquarters location and funding, the project define key topics that it hopes to address.

# Datasets 
Four datasets, spanning the years 2018 to 2021, are used in the research from various sources (database, OneDrive, and GitHub). For security and accessibility, the datasets are accessible through a GitHub repository.

# Data Processing:
The pertinent Python packages—Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn—that are used for data cleansing, modification, and visualization are described in the README.

# Conclusion 
With the purpose of facilitating strategic decision-making on possible investments and interactions within the dynamic ecosystem, the initiative seeks to provide an overview of the Indian startup scene.
